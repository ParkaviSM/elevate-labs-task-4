# Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **feature engineering fundamentals** using the **Adult Income Dataset**. The goal is to prepare raw data for machine learning models by applying **encoding techniques**, **feature scaling**, and validating **model readiness before and after scaling**.

This task is designed as part of an **internship / academic lab exercise** to help interns understand how preprocessing impacts ML performance.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – encoding, scaling, and modeling
* **Google Colab** – execution environment

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Dataset:** Adult Income Dataset (UCI ML Repository)

**Objective:** Predict whether a person earns `>50K` or `<=50K` annually based on census data.

### 🔹 Sample Features

* Age
* Workclass
* Education
* Occupation
* Capital Gain / Loss
* Hours per week
* Native country

**Target Variable:** `income`

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Handled missing values (`?` replaced with NaN)
* Removed rows with missing data

### 2️⃣ Feature Identification

* **Numerical Features:** age, fnlwgt, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week
* **Categorical Features:** workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country

---

## 🔤 Encoding Techniques

### 🔹 Label Encoding

Applied to the **target variable (`income`)** because it has an inherent order:

* `<=50K → 0`
* `>50K → 1`

### 🔹 One-Hot Encoding

Applied to **categorical input features** where no natural order exists. This prevents ordinal bias and improves model performance.

---

## 📐 Feature Scaling

### 🔹 StandardScaler

Used to scale numerical features so that:

* Mean = 0
* Standard deviation = 1

### 🔹 Why Scaling is Important

* Prevents dominance of large-value features
* Improves convergence speed
* Essential for distance-based algorithms

Algorithms affected by scaling:

* Logistic Regression
* KNN
* SVM
* Gradient Descent–based models

## 🤖 Model Readiness Comparison

A **Logistic Regression model** was trained:

| Condition       | Result                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Without Scaling | Lower / unstable accuracy     |
| With Scaling    | Improved accuracy & stability |

A visualization in the notebook compares model performance before and after scaling.

## 💾 Output

* Fully encoded and scaled dataset saved as:

  ```
  adult_income_preprocessed.csv
  ```
* Dataset is ready for use in ML models


or building reliable and accurate machine learning models.*
